    """
    Returns an abstract Django model, with a ``deleted`` field.
    It will also have a custom default manager, and an overriden ``delete()`` method.

    :param policy: define what happens when you delete an object. It can be one of ``HARD_DELETE``, ``SOFT_DELETE`` and ``HARD_DELETE_NOCASCADE``.
    :param visibility: useful to define how deleted objects can be accessed. It can be ``DELETED_INVISIBLE`` (by default), or ``DELETED_VISIBLE_BY_FIELD``.
    :param visibility_field: define which field the model should be visible by. Field should be unique. Defaults to 'pk'

    :param manager_superclass: if you want, you can make your manager inherits from another class. Useful if you need to use a custom manager.
    :param queryset_superclass: the manager that will be created will return a queryset instance, which class will inherits from this class.
    :param db_index: if True, a database index will be created for this field. Defaults to False.
    :param verbose_name: useful for localization. It can be used with ugettext(), e. g. "verbose_name=_('deleted')". Defaults to None.

    :Example:

        >>> my_mixin = safedelete_mixin_factory(policy=SOFT_DELETE)
        >>> class MyModel(my_mixin):
        ...     my_field = models.TextField()
        ...
        >>> # Now you have your model (with its ``deleted`` field, and custom manager and delete method)
